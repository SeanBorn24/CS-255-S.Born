**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass is a company that wanted to design an online system where student drivers can take practice tests, online courses and schedule in person driving lessons depending on the packages that they order. I was asked to desig the online system that allows students to purchase the packages, attend online classes and take practice tests. 

**What did you do particularly well?**
In project two I beleive that my activity diagrams were clear and easy to read. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I think that I would want to redo the presentation because I beleive that my sppeaker notes were not as clear as they possible could be.
